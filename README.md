## 📚 About The Project

I made this project to learn how to integrate Prisma and express, which I never did, therefore I reckon it was a great experience for me.

I also wanted to experiment working with more than two relations on the database, that's why I believe this helped me acquire some knowledge in this situation.

I intend to add some features to this project, such as adding likes or stars to each post, but I still have to figure out how to implement them.
